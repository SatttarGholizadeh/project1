        <p>This section is non-normative.

            In short: Yes.
            
            In more length: the term "HTML5" is widely used as a buzzword to
             refer to modern web technologies, many of which
             (though by no means all) are developed at the WHATWG. 
             This document is one such; others are available from the WHATWG
              Standards overview.

            HTML is the World Wide Web's core markup language.
             Originally, HTML was primarily designed as a language for 
             semantically describing scientific documents.
              Its general design, however, has enabled it to be
               adapted, over the subsequent years, to describe a number 
               of other types of documents and even applications.

            This section is non-normative.

            This specification is intended for authors of documents and scripts 
            that use the features defined in this specification, implementers of
             tools that operate on pages that use the features defined in this 
             specification, and individuals wishing to establish the correctness
              of documents or implementations with respect to the requirements of
               this specification.

            This document is probably not suited to readers who do not already
             have at least a passing familiarity with web technologies, as in 
             places it sacrifices clarity for precision, and brevity for 
             completeness. More approachable tutorials and authoring guides
              can provide a gentler introduction to the topic.

            In particular, familiarity with the basics of DOM is necessary for
             a complete understanding of some of the more technical parts of this
              specification. An understanding of Web IDL, HTTP, XML, Unicode, 
              character encodings, JavaScript, and CSS will also be helpful in
               places but is not essential.

            This section is non-normative.

            This specification is limited to providing a semantic-level markup
             language and associated semantic-level scripting APIs for authoring
              accessible pages on the web ranging from static documents to
               dynamic applications.

            The scope of this specification does not include providing
             mechanisms for media-specific customization of presentation
             (although default rendering rules for web browsers are included at
              the end of this specification, and several mechanisms for hooking 
              into CSS are provided as part of the language).

            The scope of this specification is not to describe an entire 
            operating system. In particular, hardware configuration software, 
            image manipulation tools, and applications that users would be 
            expected to use with high-end workstations on a daily basis are out
             of scope. In terms of applications, this specification is targeted 
             specifically at applications that would be expected to be used by 
             users on an occasional basis, or regularly but from disparate 
             locations, with low CPU requirements. Examples of such applications
              include online purchasing systems, searching systems, games 
              (especially multiplayer online games), public telephone books or 
              address books, communications software 
              (email clients, instant messaging clients, discussion software),
               document editing software, etc.
